# ADR: Architecture Decisions for Ticketing Platform

1- Context
We disigned a ticketing platform with OIDC auth, Idempotent APIs, and distributed tracing.

2- Decisions
	- Use UUIDs for all resource ids
	- Use 'Idempotency-key' for safe retries
	- Use 'traceparent' for observability
	- Separate containers for tickets, identity, and notifications

3- Rationale
	- UUIDs ensure global uniqueness and traceability
	- Idempotency-key protects for request duplication
	- Traceparent ensure the observability across the service
	- Container separation for resilience and scalability

4- Consequences
	- Easier debugging via traceId
	- safe retries without duplication
	- Isolation between the services
